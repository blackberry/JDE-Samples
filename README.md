# BlackBerry&reg; JDE Samples

The BlackBerry&reg; JDE Samples project is an Open Source repository of samples that in the past were released within the BlackBerry&reg; Java&reg; Development Environment or BlackBerry&reg; Java&reg; Plug-in for Eclipse&reg;.  The samples range in scope from Hello World, to Advanced UI components and include both samples and libraries that offer extended functionality.

Sample code is available that matches JDE released from 4.5.0 to 7.1.0 beta.  The samples in the project have been re-formatted and adjusted for Open Source release.  Branches and Tags have/will been created to match the state of the samples as they were/are released along with a BlackBerry&reg; Java&reg; Development Environment.

The sample code is Open Source under the [Apache 2.0 License][].
